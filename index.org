* Introduction
I'm a rising freshman at (UIUC) in Computer Science. I have extensive experience in using PyTorch for training various deep learning models and some experience in computer vision.

** Using deep learning to non-iteratively conduct palette generation in class specific color quantization
Color quantization (CQ) is the process of reducing the amount of colors in an image with minimal loss in visual quality. The classical way of conducting CQ is by using K-Means to perform the palette generation step, which is fairly slow. This project investigated using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform palette generation instead. We found that CNNs have the potential to perform on-par with K-Means in Mean Squared Error between the original and quantized images. Additionally, we found that CNNs have far lower runtimes than K-Means. As per our project title, we investigated whether CNNs were class specific and found that they were not. This means that CNNs can be generalized across many categories of images for CQ.
